# NHIS-HMO-Record-Keeper

## This is one of my very first projects written many years ago.
## Many of the programming approach in it is totally erronous and I have not had time to rewrite the program

### Backend - python, sqlite3
### Frontend - tkinter (python)

```diff
- Note: The code will break without the database file (in same path as addrecord.py);  
that is because I did not ask the tables to create if not exists.

- I leave that to anyone interested to fix, I believe it's a small one
```

```diff
! NHIS: National Health Insurance Scheme
! HMO: Health Management Organization
```
